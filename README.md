```

Every attribute is optional and falls back to Related Posts → Settings. The full list is in [readme.txt](readme.txt).

## Developer hooks

| Hook | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `alrp_related_posts_query_args` | Filter the related posts query |
| `alrp_related_posts_html` | Filter the final HTML |
| `alrp_template_path` | Change which template file is loaded |
| `alrp_cache_ttl` | Cache lifetime in seconds (default one day) |
| `alrp_relevance_weights` | Points per shared term for "Most relevant" |
| `alrp_video_urls` | Tutorial video URLs shown on the settings page |

Themes can override `templates/posts.php` and `templates/category.php` by copying them to `yourtheme/softicon-related-posts/`.

## Repository layout

`src/` holds the block source and `build/` is generated from it, so run `npm install` and `npm run build` after cloning. `npm run zip` builds the release zip.

`.wordpress-org/` holds the WordPress.org banner, icon and screenshots. It is not part of the plugin zip.

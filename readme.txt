Show related posts by category, tag or taxonomy. Smart relevance, Gutenberg block, grid and list layouts, WooCommerce support, built-in cache.

== Description ==

**SoftIcon Related Posts** shows your readers what to read next. It finds similar posts that share categories, tags or any custom taxonomy with the current article, ranks them by relevance, and displays them below your content in a clean, responsive grid, list or minimal layout.

Every related post is an internal link. More internal links help visitors discover more of your content, keep them on your site longer and help search engines understand how your articles connect.

It works the moment you activate it: related posts appear below every post with no setup. When you want more control, use the settings page, the **Related Posts block**, the shortcode or the sidebar widget.

= How it works =

1. Install and activate the plugin.
2. Related posts appear below every post right away.
3. Open **Related Posts → Settings** to choose how posts are matched, ordered and displayed.
4. Optional: add the Related Posts block anywhere, or hand-pick related posts in the post editor.

= Shortcode =

`[softicon_related_posts posts="4" columns="2" relation="tag" orderby="relevance" layout="list" title="You may also like"]`

Supported attributes: post_id, posts, columns, relation (category, tag, both, all), orderby (relevance, rand, date, modified, comment_count, title), title, show_categories, show_image, show_excerpt, show_date, show_author, show_read_more, layout (grid, list, minimal), image_ratio (fixed, 16-9, 4-3, 3-2, 1-1), card_style (none, border, shadow), radius, hover_zoom, title_color, text_color, card_bg. Any attribute you leave out uses the value from the settings page.

= For developers =

The block's editor script is built from source. The full source code, including `src/` and the build setup, is on GitHub: [github.com/alamingitpailot/softicon-related-post](https://github.com/alamingitpailot/softicon-related-post). Pull requests are welcome.

Copy `templates/posts.php` or `templates/category.php` into `yourtheme/softicon-related-posts/` to change the markup.

* `alrp_related_posts_query_args` – filter the related posts query
* `alrp_related_posts_html` – filter the final HTML
* `alrp_template_path` – change which template file is loaded
* `alrp_cache_ttl` – cache lifetime in seconds (default one day)
* `alrp_relevance_weights` – points per shared term for "Most relevant" (default category 1, tag 2)
* `alrp_related_post_ids` – filter or reorder the final list of related post IDs
* `alrp_auto_display` – return false to stop the automatic list on a post
* `alrp_wrapper_classes` / `alrp_wrapper_style_vars` – add classes or CSS variables to the wrapper
* `alrp_default_settings`, `alrp_setting_choices`, `alrp_sanitize_settings` – add your own settings
* `alrp_block_atts` – map extra block attributes to settings
* `alrp_render_settings` – adjust the settings a single list is rendered with
* `alrp_item_after_title` / `alrp_item_end` (actions) – add markup inside each card, e.g. a price
* `alrp_video_urls` – tutorial video URLs shown on the settings page

Settings page (JavaScript, `@wordpress/hooks`): `alrp.settings.tabs` adds tabs, `alrp.settings.layouts` and `alrp.settings.layoutArt` add layout tiles, `alrp.block.inspector` adds panels to the block sidebar.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How do I show related posts in WordPress? =

Install and activate SoftIcon Related Posts. Related posts appear below every post automatically. To place them somewhere else, use the Related Posts block or the `[softicon_related_posts]` shortcode.

= How do I show related posts by tags instead of categories? =

Go to Related Posts → Settings and set "Related by" to "Same tag", or to "Same category or tag" to use both.

= How does "Most relevant" work? =

Posts that share more tags and categories with the current post come first. A shared tag counts twice as much as a shared category, because tags are usually more specific. Ties are broken by date, newest first.

= Will it slow down my site? =

No. Related posts are cached and refreshed automatically when your content changes, so most page views run no related-posts query at all. The front end loads one small stylesheet and no JavaScript.

= Does it work with WooCommerce? =

Yes. Tick "Products" under Related Posts → Settings → Post types and set "Related by" to "Any shared taxonomy". Related products are matched by product categories and tags and shown inside the product description.

= Does it work with block themes and Full Site Editing? =

Yes. Set Position to "Manual (shortcode only)", then open Appearance → Editor, edit the Single Posts template and add the Related Posts block where you want it.

= Can I show related posts in the sidebar? =

Yes. In classic themes, add the "SoftIcon Related Posts" widget to your sidebar. In block themes, add the Related Posts block to a template part or widget area.

= Can I choose related posts myself? =

Yes. In the post editor, use "Pick related posts" in the Related Posts box. Your picks are shown first, in the order you added them, and the remaining slots are filled automatically. Hand-picked posts are shown even if they are in an excluded category.

= Can I exclude categories or posts? =

Yes. Under Related Posts → Settings → Filters you can exclude categories, exclude individual posts by ID and only show posts from the last few months.

= How do I hide related posts on one post? =

Open the post in the editor and tick "Hide related posts on this post" in the Related Posts box.

= Does the block replace the automatic related posts? =

Yes. If a post already contains the Related Posts block or the shortcode, the automatic list is not added to that post, so related posts never show twice.

= Why don't related posts show on my pages? =

Pages have no categories or tags, so nothing is found automatically. Enable Pages under Post types and use "Pick related posts" in the page editor.

= Why don't the RSS feed links appear? =

They are added to the full text of feed items. Check that Settings → Reading → "For each post in a feed, include" is set to "Full text".

= Can I change the design or the HTML? =

Use the Design options in Related Posts → Settings or in the block sidebar. For full control, copy the templates into your theme (see "For developers").

= Does it collect any data? =

The plugin never tracks your visitors and sets no cookies on your site.

After activation, the plugin asks if you want to opt in to security and feature update emails and share basic, non-sensitive diagnostic data (WordPress, PHP and plugin versions, site URL and admin email) with us through [Freemius](https://freemius.com). It is entirely optional: click "Skip" and nothing is sent. The Add-Ons page loads its list of add-ons from Freemius. See the [Freemius privacy policy](https://freemius.com/privacy/).

= Is it translation ready? =

Yes. All text can be translated, and a translation template is included in the `languages` folder.
